## Props

| Name | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| <strong>value</strong> <sup><em>required</em></sup> | `string` |  |
| <strong>accessibilityActions</strong> | `string[]` | Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.<br>@platform ios |
| <strong>accessibilityComponentType</strong> | `"none" \| "button" \| "radiobutton_checked" \| "radiobutton_unchecked"` | In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).<br>If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to<br>provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property<br>for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.<br>@platform android |

| <strong>hitSlop</strong> | `Insets` | This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.<br>Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least<br>30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has<br>a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with<br>hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}<br>NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and<br>the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch<br>hits two overlapping views. |
| <strong>importantForAccessibility</strong> | `"auto" \| "yes" \| "no" \| "no-hide-descendants"` | Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events<br>and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.<br>Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.<br><br>Possible values:<br>      'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).<br>      'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.<br>      'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.<br>      'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views. |

| <strong>keyboardType</strong> | `KeyboardTypeOptions` | enum("default", 'numeric', 'email-address', "ascii-capable", 'numbers-and-punctuation', 'url', 'number-pad', 'phone-pad', 'name-phone-pad',<br>'decimal-pad', 'twitter', 'web-search', 'visible-password')<br>Determines which keyboard to open, e.g.numeric.<br>The following values work across platforms: - default - numeric - email-address - phone-pad<br>The following values work on iOS: - ascii-capable - numbers-and-punctuation - url - number-pad - name-phone-pad - decimal-pad - twitter - web-search<br>The following values work on Android: - visible-password |
| <strong>maxFontSizeMultiplier</strong> | `number` | Specifies largest possible scale a font can reach when allowFontScaling is enabled. Possible values:<br>- null/undefined (default): inherit from the parent node or the global default (0)<br>- 0: no max, ignore parent/global default<br>- >= 1: sets the maxFontSizeMultiplier of this node to this value |
| <strong>maxLength</strong> | `number` | Limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered.<br>Use this instead of implementing the logic in JS to avoid flicker. |
| <strong>multiline</strong> | `boolean` | If true, the text input can be multiple lines. The default value is false. |
| <strong>nativeID</strong> | `string` | Used to reference react managed views from native code. |
| <strong>needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing</strong> | `boolean` | Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.<br>The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children<br>with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.<br>This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on<br>has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).<br><br>Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive<br>and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.<br>If you do need to enable this property for an animation,<br>consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).<br>If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,<br>saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU. |
| <strong>numberOfLines</strong> | `number` | Sets the number of lines for a TextInput.<br>Use it with multiline set to true to be able to fill the lines. |
| <strong>onAccessibilityAction</strong> | `() => void` | When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function<br>when the user performs an accessibility custom action.<br>@platform ios |
| <strong>onAccessibilityTap</strong> | `() => void` | When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.<br>@platform ios |

| <strong>onChange</strong> | `(value: string) => void` |  |
| <strong>onContentSizeChange</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputContentSizeChangeEventData>) => void` | Callback that is called when the text input's content size changes.<br>This will be called with<br>`{ nativeEvent: { contentSize: { width, height } } }`.<br><br>Only called for multiline text inputs. |

| <strong>onFocus</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputFocusEventData>) => void` | Callback that is called when the text input is focused |
| <strong>onKeyPress</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputKeyPressEventData>) => void` | Callback that is called when a key is pressed.<br>This will be called with<br>  `{ nativeEvent: { key: keyValue } }`<br>where keyValue is 'Enter' or 'Backspace' for respective keys and the typed-in character otherwise including ' ' for space.<br><br>Fires before onChange callbacks.<br>Note: on Android only the inputs from soft keyboard are handled, not the hardware keyboard inputs. |
| <strong>onLayout</strong> | `(event: LayoutChangeEvent) => void` | Invoked on mount and layout changes with<br><br>{nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}. |
| <strong>onMagicTap</strong> | `() => void` | When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.<br>@platform ios |
| <strong>onMoveShouldSetResponder</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => boolean` | Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness? |
| <strong>onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => boolean` | onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,<br>where the deepest node is called first.<br>That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.<br>This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.<br><br>However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.<br>This can be handled by using the capture phase.<br>Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,<br>it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.<br>So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,<br>it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. |
| <strong>onResponderEnd</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` | If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen: |
| <strong>onResponderGrant</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` | The View is now responding for touch events.<br>This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening |

| <strong>onResponderReject</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` | Something else is the responder right now and will not release it |
| <strong>onResponderRelease</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` | Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp" |
| <strong>onResponderStart</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` |  |
| <strong>onResponderTerminate</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` | The responder has been taken from the View.<br>Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,<br>or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS) |
| <strong>onResponderTerminationRequest</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => boolean` | Something else wants to become responder.<br>Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release |
| <strong>onScroll</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputScrollEventData>) => void` | Invoked on content scroll with<br>  `{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x, y } } }`.<br><br>May also contain other properties from ScrollEvent but on Android contentSize is not provided for performance reasons. |
| <strong>onSelectionChange</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputSelectionChangeEventData>) => void` | Callback that is called when the text input selection is changed. |
| <strong>onStartShouldSetResponder</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => boolean` | A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.<br>There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:<br>Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch? |
| <strong>onStartShouldSetResponderCapture</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => boolean` | onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,<br>where the deepest node is called first.<br>That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.<br>This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.<br><br>However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.<br>This can be handled by using the capture phase.<br>Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,<br>it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.<br>So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,<br>it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true. |
| <strong>onSubmitEditing</strong> | `(e: NativeSyntheticEvent<TextInputSubmitEditingEventData>) => void` | Callback that is called when the text input's submit button is pressed. |
| <strong>onTouchCancel</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` |  |
| <strong>onTouchEnd</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` |  |
| <strong>onTouchEndCapture</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` |  |

| <strong>onTouchStart</strong> | `(event: GestureResponderEvent) => void` |  |
| <strong>placeholder</strong> | `string` | The string that will be rendered before text input has been entered |
| <strong>placeholderTextColor</strong> | `string` | The text color of the placeholder string |
| <strong>pointerEvents</strong> | `"none" \| "box-none" \| "box-only" \| "auto"` | In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:<br><br>.box-none {<br>   pointer-events: none;<br>}<br>.box-none * {<br>   pointer-events: all;<br>}<br><br>box-only is the equivalent of<br><br>.box-only {<br>   pointer-events: all;<br>}<br>.box-only * {<br>   pointer-events: none;<br>}<br><br>But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,<br>we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform. |
| <strong>removeClippedSubviews</strong> | `boolean` | This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,<br>most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.<br>The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews). |
| <strong>renderToHardwareTextureAndroid</strong> | `boolean` | Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.<br><br>On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:<br>in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be<br>re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation. |
| <strong>returnKeyLabel</strong> | `string` | Sets the return key to the label. Use it instead of `returnKeyType`.<br>@platform android |
| <strong>returnKeyType</strong> | `ReturnKeyTypeOptions` | enum('default', 'go', 'google', 'join', 'next', 'route', 'search', 'send', 'yahoo', 'done', 'emergency-call')<br>Determines how the return key should look. |
| <strong>scrollEnabled</strong> | `boolean` | If false, scrolling of the text view will be disabled. The default value is true. Only works with multiline={true} |
| <strong>secureTextEntry</strong> | `boolean` | If true, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure.<br>The default value is false. |
| <strong>selectTextOnFocus</strong> | `boolean` | If true, all text will automatically be selected on focus |
| <strong>selection</strong> | `{ start: number; end?: number; }` | The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to<br>the same value to position the cursor. |
| <strong>selectionColor</strong> | `string` | The highlight (and cursor on ios) color of the text input |
| <strong>selectionState</strong> | `DocumentSelectionState` | See DocumentSelectionState.js, some state that is responsible for maintaining selection information for a document |
| <strong>shouldRasterizeIOS</strong> | `boolean` | Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.<br><br>On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;<br>for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view<br>and quickly composite it during each frame.<br><br>Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.<br>Test and measure when using this property. |
| <strong>spellCheck</strong> | `boolean` | If false, disables spell-check style (i.e. red underlines). The default value is inherited from autoCorrect |
| <strong>style</strong> | `StyleProp<TextStyle>` | Styles |
| <strong>testID</strong> | `string` | Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests |
| <strong>textAlignVertical</strong> | `"auto" \| "top" \| "bottom" \| "center"` | Vertically align text when `multiline` is set to true |
| <strong>textBreakStrategy</strong> | `"simple" \| "highQuality" \| "balanced"` | Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+, possible values are simple, highQuality, balanced<br>The default value is simple. |
| <strong>textContentType</strong> | `"none" \| "URL" \| "addressCity" \| "addressCityAndState" \| "addressState" \| "countryName" \| "creditCardNumber" \| "emailAddress" \| "familyName" \| "fullStreetAddress" \| "givenName" \| ... 16 more ... \| "oneTimeCode"` | Give the keyboard and the system information about the expected<br>semantic meaning for the content that users enter.<br><br>For iOS 11+ you can set `textContentType` to `username` or `password` to<br>enable autofill of login details from the device keychain.<br><br>For iOS 12+ `newPassword` can be used to indicate a new password input the<br>user may want to save in the keychain, and `oneTimeCode` can be used to indicate<br>that a field can be autofilled by a code arriving in an SMS.<br><br>To disable autofill, set textContentType to `none`.<br><br>Possible values for `textContentType` are:<br><br>  - `'none'`<br>  - `'URL'`<br>  - `'addressCity'`<br>  - `'addressCityAndState'`<br>  - `'addressState'`<br>  - `'countryName'`<br>  - `'creditCardNumber'`<br>  - `'emailAddress'`<br>  - `'familyName'`<br>  - `'fullStreetAddress'`<br>  - `'givenName'`<br>  - `'jobTitle'`<br>  - `'location'`<br>  - `'middleName'`<br>  - `'name'`<br>  - `'namePrefix'`<br>  - `'nameSuffix'`<br>  - `'nickname'`<br>  - `'organizationName'`<br>  - `'postalCode'`<br>  - `'streetAddressLine1'`<br>  - `'streetAddressLine2'`<br>  - `'sublocality'`<br>  - `'telephoneNumber'`<br>  - `'username'`<br>  - `'password'`<br>  - `'newPassword'`<br>  - `'oneTimeCode'` |
